# cozy-api

`cozy-api` is a javascript library made by Cozy. It enables client-side  applications to make requests to the cozy stack.

Cozy-api is compatible with both cozy architectures.

## This repository is a stub where the stack-v2 companion javascript library is being developed.

To learn more about the stack-v2, head over to [its repository](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack).

If you are getting started on cozy application development, you should follow this [tutorial](https://dev.cozy.io/clientsideapp.html) and use the current `cozy-browser-sdk`. Transitioning from the cozy-browser-sdk library to this one should imply minimal changes (see [https://github.com/cozy/cozy-api/blob/master/docs/browser-sdk-transition.md])
