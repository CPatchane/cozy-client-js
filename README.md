[Cozy][cozy] API
=======================


What's Cozy?
------------

![Cozy Logo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/cozy/cozy-guidelines/master/templates/cozy_logo_small.svg)

[Cozy][cozy] is a platform that brings all your web services in the same private space.  With it, your webapps and your devices can share data easily, providing you with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own hardware where no one's tracking you.


What's API?
------------------

`cozy-client-js` is a javascript library made by Cozy. It enables client-side  applications to make requests to the cozy stack.

Cozy-api is compatible with both cozy architectures.

## This repository is a stub where the stack-v2 companion javascript library is being developed.

To learn more about the stack-v2, head over to [its repository](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack).

If you are getting started on cozy application development, you should follow this [tutorial](https://dev.cozy.io/clientsideapp.html) and use the current `cozy-browser-sdk`. Transitioning from the cozy-browser-sdk library to this one should imply minimal changes (see [transition doc](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-client-js/blob/master/docs/browser-sdk-transition.md]) )



Hack
----

### Install

You can clone the repository and install dependencies:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-client-js.git
$ cd cozy-client-js
$ npm install
```

:pushpin: If you use a node environment wrapper like [nvm] or [ndenv], don't forget to set your local node version before doing a `npm install`.


### Tests

Tests are run by [mocha] under the hood, and written using [should]. You can easily run the tests suite with:

```sh
$ cd cozy-client-js
$ npm run test
```

:pushpin: Don't forget to update / create new tests when you contribute to code to keep the app the consistent.


### Resources

All documentation is located in the `/docs` app directory. It provides an exhaustive documentation about workflows (installation, development, pull-requestsâ€¦), architecture, code consistency, data structures, dependencies, and more.

Feel free to read it and fix / update it if needed, all comments and feedback to improve it are welcome!
